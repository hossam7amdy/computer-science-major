# Computer Networks and the Internet

## What is the Internet?

1. The Internet is a _network of networks_ composed of:

- **End systems** (hosts): run application programs
- **Communication links**: fiber, copper, radio, satellite
- **Packet switches**: forward packets (chunks of data)

2. Internet as an infrastructure that provides services to applications:

- Interconnected **ISPs**
- **Protocols** rule of communication (TCP, IP, HTTP, etc.)
- **Internet standards**:
  - RFC: Request for comments
  - IETF: Internet Engineering Task Force

## Internet History

- 1961: Kleinrock - queueing theory shows effectiveness of packet-switching
- 1964: Baran - packet-switching in military nets
- 1967: ARPAnet conceived by Advanced Research Projects Agency
- 1969: first ARPAnet node operational
- 1972: ARPAnet public (15 nodes) demonstration (NCP)
- 1974: Cerf and Kahn - architecture for interconnecting networks
  - minimalism, autonomy - no internal changes required to interconnect networks
  - best effort service model
  - stateless routers
  - decentralized control
- 1976: Ethernet at Xerox PARC
- Late 70's: proprietary architectures: DECnet, SNA, XNA
- 1983: deployment of TCP/IP
- 1982: SMTP e-mail protocol defined
- 1983: DNS defined for name-to-IP-address translation
- 1985: FTP protocol defined
- 1988: TCP congestion control
- early 1990's: commercialization of the Internet
- 1991: NSF lifts restrictions on commercial use of NSFnet (decommissioned, 1995)
- early 1990s: Web
  - hypertext [Bush 1945, Nelson 1960's]
  - HTML, HTTP: Berners-Lee
  - 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape
- Mid 1990's: commercialization of the Web
- late 1990's - 2000's: more killer apps: instant messaging, P2P file sharing
