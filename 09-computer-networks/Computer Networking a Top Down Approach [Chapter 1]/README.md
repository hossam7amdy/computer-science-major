# Computer Networks and the Internet

## What is the Internet?

### A Nuts-and-Bolts View

Millions of connected computing devices **hosts** running network apps (e.g., web, email), communicating over **communication links** (e.g., fiber, copper, radio, satellite) **transmitting** data **packets** (chunks of data) **switching** (forwarding) packets through **routers** (aka **switches**)

### A Services View

Infrastructure that provides services to applications: Web, VoIP, email, games, e-commerce, social nets, search, etc.

### What is a Protocol?

A protocol define **format**, **order** of messages sent and received among network entities, and **actions** taken on message transmission receipt.

## Network Edge

**End systems (hosts):** run application programs (e.g., Web, email); at **edge** of network
**Access Networks:** wired, wireless communication links connecting end systems to network edge (DSL, cable, FTTH, LTE, 5G, etc.)
**Physical media:** copper, fiber, radio, satellite (transmission rate: **bandwidth**)

## Network Core

**packet/circuit switches:** forward packets (chunks of data)
**Internet structure:** network of networks

## Network Performance

## Protocol Layers and Service Models

## Network Security

## History of Computer Networking and the Internet

- 1961: Kleinrock - queueing theory shows effectiveness of packet-switching
- 1964: Baran - packet-switching in military nets
- 1967: ARPAnet conceived by Advanced Research Projects Agency
- 1969: first ARPAnet node operational
- 1972: ARPAnet public (15 nodes) demonstration (NCP)
- 1974: Cerf and Kahn - architecture for interconnecting networks
  - minimalism, autonomy - no internal changes required to interconnect networks
  - best effort service model
  - stateless routers
  - decentralized control
- 1976: Ethernet at Xerox PARC
- Late 70's: proprietary architectures: DECnet, SNA, XNA
- 1983: deployment of TCP/IP
- 1982: SMTP e-mail protocol defined
- 1983: DNS defined for name-to-IP-address translation
- 1985: FTP protocol defined
- 1988: TCP congestion control
- early 1990's: commercialization of the Internet
- 1991: NSF lifts restrictions on commercial use of NSFnet (decommissioned, 1995)
- early 1990s: Web
  - hypertext [Bush 1945, Nelson 1960's]
  - HTML, HTTP: Berners-Lee
  - 1994: Mosaic, later Netscape
- Mid 1990's: commercialization of the Web
- late 1990's - 2000's: more killer apps: instant messaging, P2P file sharing
