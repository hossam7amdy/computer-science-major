It fails
Because if a path has length 4 edges then it gets 4c added whereas a 
path of length 2 edges gets 2c added. Might change which path is shortest

Consider this graph

0 1 2
1 2 2
0 3 3
3 4 -3
4 2 3

Shortest path has from 0-2
	2+2 = 4 vs 3-3+3 = 3 (winner)

Add +3 to each edge
	5+5 = 10 (winner) vs 6+0+6 = 12, which is wrong!

- Some of our claims can be worng
- You can proof your claims by:
	- Find a counter-example & proof it is correct

NOTES:
 - In Graph Thoery: You must provide a valid proof not just some Intuitions
 - Other Topics Like (DB, BS, ...) doesn't necessary need such a proof.
