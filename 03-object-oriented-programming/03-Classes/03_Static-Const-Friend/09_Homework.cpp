/// Future Features
/*
● A fresh developer approached the team leader with the following suggestion
    ○ From an informal discussion with a customer, it seems after 6 months we will need:
■ Several printing styles & streams (file, console)
■ Maintaining statistics about every used function and providing getters for them
    ○ He suggests to implement these extensions now to save future time for other features
● As a leader
    ○ Do you accept? Or Reject? Or Suggest an alternative?
    ○ Why?

- One of the popular principles is You aren't gonna need it (YAGNI)
- Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them
- Otherwise, they might be actually useless features and the team just lost resources for nothing
- Side note: It is good that the design allows extensions, but implement when need
