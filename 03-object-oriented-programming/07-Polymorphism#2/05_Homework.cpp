/// Homework 5: Another Company Payroll
/*
● Recall we have Employee and Invoice which are Payable
    ○ But implement this separately for simplicity.
    ○ E.g. no types of employees. Employee has name and salary
● Payable class should be Cloneable, Printable and Comparable
● CompanyPayroll, which is collection of Payables, should be Printable and Sortable
    ○ Sortable means we can call function to order the collection of items
    ○ To sort the collection, each type should be grouped together
■ Within each group, should be compared based on comparable property
    ● E.g. for employee: sort by salary, then by name
    ○ E.g. employees printed first, then invoices after them
