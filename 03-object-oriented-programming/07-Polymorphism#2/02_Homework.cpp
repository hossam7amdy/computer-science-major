/// Homework 2: Expedia Travel Site
/*
● In expedia a user has several itineraries, each itinerary consists of several reservations as following
    ○ 0 or more flights, hotels, cars, etc. E.g. 4 flights, 2 hotels and 2 cars.
    ○ Consider only flights (one way no transit) and hotels (but create extensible design).
● An itinerary item (e.g. a flight) has:
    ○ Relevant info: E.g. Hotel cost: total nights x price per night
    ○ Itinerary cost is the sum of all internal items costs.
● Design the set of classes that help developing the system + UML
    ○ Task scope: Only reservation classes + relevant concerns
